Created a web application (using streamlit) that estimates the ratings (0-5) of a restaurant with the given user review.

## Motivation
People in general, do not pay attention to the review which is present in the restaurant's website. In this fast paced world, all they care about is the rating. Hence, to generalise it, review based on the content written can be used to normalize the ratings of the restaurants.

## Techonolgies Used 
This project uses Numpy 1.18.3, Pandas 1.0.4, Joblib 0.15.1, Scikit_Learn 0.23.1 and Streamlit 0.61.0, Tensorflow 2.0.0 , regex 2020.6.8, nltk 3.5.

## Environment 
The Streamlit code was run on Spyder environment. The Data Cleaning and Model Building were run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Models Used
LSTM Model was used to predict the ratings
